# Game-Show-App
 Unit 06 Project
 
In this project, I have created a broswer version of "Wheel of Success". The purpose of this guessing game to click on the letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase.

I have used Javascript to create an array of phrases and have created functions to choose a random phrase from the array, split the phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the game board.

Each time the player guesses a ltter, the function compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the ltter is in the phrase, the game will update with the chosen letters.

A player has the ability to choose letters until they make 5 incorrect guesses. 

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen will display. If the player guesses incorrectly 5 times, a losing screen will display. 

A player is only allowed a guess a letter once. After they've guessed a letter, the program will disable the letter chosen.
